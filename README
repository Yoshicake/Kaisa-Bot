Here is the code to a personal Discord bot I have been making. It is made in JavaScript and themed on the character Kai'Sa from League of Legends. As of 12/29/2023 it can do five things:

- Say "Hey!"
- Say a quote from the game.
- Play rock, paper, scissors
- Flip a coin
- Link to a League champion's build from u.gg
- Link to a player's tracker.gg stats (League of Legends and Fortnite)
