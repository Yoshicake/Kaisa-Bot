Here is the code to a personal Discord bot I have been making. It is made in JavaScript and themed on the character Kai'Sa from League of Legends. As of 07/03/2024 it can do these things:

- Say "Hey!"
- Say a quote from the game.
- Play rock, paper, scissors
- Flip a coin
- Link to a League champion's build from u.gg
- Link to a player's tracker.gg stats (League of Legends, Valorant and Fortnite)
- Show a custom status ( try clicking the link :) )
